# Chapter 1 Exercises

Exercises with a tick mark :ballot_box_with_check: represent exercises that must be submitted as part of your Programming Skills Portfolio as a minimum expectation. Completing more exercises provides the opportunity to attain higher marks. For each exercise you should create a _**new project**_ with the name of the exercise and save it to this exercises folder in your local repository.

Once you have completed your solution you should make sure you commit and push your solutions to your remote repository on GitHub. You can commit and push as many changes to your solutions as you wish, only those pushed before the chapter deadlines will be marked for the Programming Skills Portfolio.

## Exercise 1: Variables:ballot_box_with_check:

Type out the code below and add the correct data types to complete the variables

Assign a message to a variable, and print that message.
Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new
message.

## Exercise 2: Variables :ballot_box_with_check:

Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. 

Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:

Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.

## Exercise 3: Stripping Names :ballot_box_with_check:

Tidy up the code to make it easier to understand

Use a variable to represent a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, “\t” and “\n”, at least once.

Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. 

Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().

&nbsp;
## Exercise 4: Favorite Number :ballot_box_with_check:
Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then,using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print
that message.

## Exercise 5: USB Shopper :ballot_box_with_check:

A girl heads to a computer shop to buy some USB sticks. She loves USB sticks and wants as many as she can get for £50. They are £6 each.

Write a programme that calculates how many USB sticks she can buy and how many pounds she will have left.

You will to use the arithmetic operators to complete this exercise.

## Simple Sums :ballot_box_with_check:

Set up a new project and follow the below steps:

* Declare a variable with data type integer. Initialise with a value of 8.
* Declare a variable with data type integer. Initialise with a value of 10.
* Declare a third variable of data type integer that sums the answer.
* Print the final variable to console.

## Exercise 6: Biography :ballot_box_with_check:

#### Part 1
Create a program that prints your name, hometown and age to the console. The program has the following constraints:

* Each item should be stored using a variable of an appropriate data type.
* Each item should be printed on a new line.



#### Part 2
Modify your program such that the computer asks the user for their name and hometown, then stores these in variables (hint: You can use "input" for taking the user input ) Also for now only give it your first name). Now use the variables to print the short biography with the values entered by the user.


##### Extension Problem (optional):

Try giving the program both your first and second name when asked. What do you notice? Can you provide a fix? Also when asked to enter you age enter a string value? What happens? Can you fix the problem. (hint: Google is your friend).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 7: Temperature

Part 1: Create a program to convert temperature in Fahrenheit to Celsius

*Fahrenheit to celsius → (n - 32) * 0.5556)*

You should make use of variables such that your program prints to console:

```
"X Fahrenheit is Y in Celsius"
```

Where X is the value you specify (as in an appropriate data type) and Y is the calculated result

Part 2: Enhance your program by having the computer ask the user for the temperature in Fahrenheit.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
## Exercise 8: Circles

Write a program that calculates (and displays) the area (A) and circumference (C) of a circle given its radius (r). The program should get the radius from the user. Make your code as clear as possible by using variables of appropriate data types and comments.

>*A = π r2  
>C = 2π r*
